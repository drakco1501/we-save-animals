    <h1>Passive Adoption</h1>
    <h3>This is a way of adoption where you'll be adopting any animal in shelter and be a parent. You will need to pay a minimum amount on a monthly basis,<br>
       and we will look after them in the shelter. These are those animals which cannot be sent to homes due to the nature of their ailment or disability<br>
        which needs constant medical attention.<br><br>
        You can help WSA by sponsoring the monthly stay, food and basic medicines of any of the rescued animals at a fee mentioned below:<br>
        Dogs - ₹1500 monthly and ₹50 per day<br>
        Cows and Calf - ₹2000 monthly and ₹66 per day<br>
        Goat and Sheep - ₹1000 monthly and ₹33 per day<br>
        Cats - ₹900 monthly and ₹30 per day<br><br>
